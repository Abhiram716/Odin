            About Dum Biryani:
        </h2>

        <p>
            <big>Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent.</big>
        </p>

        <p>
            <big>It is made with Indian spices, rice, and usually some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, fish) or in some cases without any meat, and sometimes, in addition, eggs and potatoes.</big>
        </p>

            Cooking Process:
        </h2>
        <p>
            <big>For my Chicken Biryani recipe, Iâ€™ve simplified the preparation a bit by marinating the chicken in a spicy mixture of garam masala, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, coriander leaves, and garlic. When fried, the spices and aromatics on the exterior of the chicken caramelize into an insanely flavorful crust. I like to make the fried onions separately, as it allows you to fully caramelize them into a sweet umami-packed layer that contrasts the spicy, savory chicken. For the rice, a quick par-boil with whole spices like cardamom, bay leaves, and cumin infuses some flavor, while ensuring the rice is tender enough steam after the Biryani is assembled.</big>
