            <big>Step 1 Cook the rice<br>

                To prepare this delicious Pulihora or tamarind rice recipe, wash the rice under running water in a large bowl. Next, put a pressure cooker on low flame and heat a little oil in it, when the oil is hot enough, add rice in it. Stir and then add water and close the lid of the cooker. Cook until you hear 2 whistles and let the steam release on its own.</big>

                Step 2 Soak the tamarind, fry soaked chana dal & mix cooked rice<br>

Now, soak the tamarind in a cup of hot water for 10 minutes and then, take out the extract of soaked tamarind. Keep aside. Afterwards, put a non-stick pan on medium flame and heat oil in it. Add soaked chana dal (soaked for an hour) in the pan and fry for a few seconds. Meanwhile, open the lid of the cooker and take out the rice in the pan, add turmeric powder along with oil in it and mix well. Turn off the burner and let it cool down.

Saute and then add tamarind extract along with turmeric powder and salt as per your taste. Mix all the ingredients well and bring the mixture to a boil, and let the mixture turn into a thick paste.
