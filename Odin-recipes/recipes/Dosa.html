            About Dosa:
        </h2>

        <p>
            <big>A dosa is a thin crÃªpe in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground black gram (lentil) and rice. Dosas have now become popular elsewhere in South Asia. Dosas are served hot, often with chutney and sambar.</big>

            Cooking Process:
        </h2>
        <p>
            <big>Allow the rice and dal and other ingredients to soak for at least 8 hours or overnight. I usually soak them in the morning, blend up the dosa batter in the evening, and leave it to ferment overnight so I can make fresh dosas next morning.</big>

                Some traditionalists soak the rice and dal seperately, grind them separately, and then mix them. To me that just adds unnecessary steps and I prefer to just soak everything together and pay closer attention when I blend so I get the texture right. Rice takes just a little longer to blend than the dal, which is perfect because you want the dal to blend smoothly while the rice remains very slightly gritty. That helps the dosas turn out crispy.
